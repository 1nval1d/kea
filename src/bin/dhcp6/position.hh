// Starting with Bison 3.2, this file is useless: the structure it
// used to define is now defined in "location.hh".
//
// To get rid of this file:
// 1. add 'require "3.2"' (or newer) to your grammar file
// 2. remove references to this file from your build system
// 3. if you used to include it, include "location.hh" instead.

#include "location.hh"
