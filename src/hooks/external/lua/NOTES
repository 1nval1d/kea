Implementation notes for lua

Manifest:
 - loption.h loption.cc: the C++ OptionPtr encapsulated into a lua full
  userdata with a few methods ported.

 - ppkt4.h ppkt4.cc: the C++ Pkt4Ptr encapsulated into a lua full userdata
  with a few methods ported.

  one can complete these lua types or/and new lua type.

 - dso.cc: the kea framework and hook glue: on the kea / C side it is
  a dynamic shared object providing the framework and hook entry points,
  on the lua side it embeds an interpreter which imports the lua script
  hook.lua.

  loption.o, lpkt4.o and dso.o are compiled into kea.so.

 - hook.lua: the lua script which implements the lua part of hook
  hook handlers using lua option and pkt4 modules.

 - tests.cc: source of test program which loads the kea.so hook-library
  and exercise the pkt4_receive hook. It gives an independent executable.

 - cshenv: C-shell script setting environment variables for a kea
  distrib in /tmp/kea on OS X. Note I brewed a recent (vs standard)
  version of lua (last one is 5.3.3).

 - Makefile: make config file for OS X.

 - NOTES: this file.

I was afraid to have to recompile lua for C++ but it was not (yet?)
necessary.

The preload stuff from linit.c doesn't work.

A possible bug issue: the allocator (lua_newuserdata) does NOT
clear the memory?!
