    "brief": "This command is used to delete information about a DHCPv6 server from the configuration database. Any configuration explicitly associated with the deleted server is automatically disassociated. In addition, configuration elements not shareable with other servers (e.g. global DHCP parameters) are deleted. The shareable configuration (e.g. subnets, shared networks) is not deleted as it may be used by other servers.",
